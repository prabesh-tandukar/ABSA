    abstract = { Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is the sub-field of natural language processing that deals with breaking or splitting texts into aspects and then classification into sentiments like happy, sad, angry, etc. towards the aspect. Aspect-based sentiment analysis provides more information about the context than general sentiment analysis. In this survey paper, we compared a variety of papers and the methods that were introduced through them to achieve better results for the problem at hand. As ABSA is currently being used for customer satisfaction and product feedback most of the papers have datasets containing reviews. This survey paper discusses various solutions in-depth and gives a comparison between them. Firstly, we discuss rule-based approaches and then move to complex approaches that involve both rule-based approaches and neural networks. Also, major emphasis is shed on the principles and the workflow of the method discussed. }

abstract = {The domain of Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis, in which aspects are extracted, their sentiments are analysed and sentiments are evolved over time, is getting much attention with increasing feedback of public and customers on social media. The immense advancements in this field urged the researchers to devise new techniques and approaches, each sermonizing a different research analysis/question, that cope with upcoming issues and complex scenarios of Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis. Therefore, this survey emphasized on the issues and challenges that are related to extraction of different aspects and their relevant sentiments, relational mapping between aspects, interactions, dependencies, and contextual-semantic relationships between different data objects for improved sentiment accuracy, and prediction of sentiment evolution dynamicity. A rigorous overview of the recent progress is summarized based on whether they contributed towards highlighting and mitigating the issue of Aspect Extraction, Aspect Sentiment Analysis or Sentiment Evolution. The reported performance for each scrutinized study of Aspect Extraction and Aspect Sentiment Analysis is also given, showing the quantitative evaluation of the proposed approach. Future research directions are proposed and discussed, by critically analysing the presented recent solutions, that will be helpful for researchers and beneficial for improving sentiment classification at aspect-level.},
